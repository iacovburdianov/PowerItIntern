Define a class MyString, that handles sequences of characters (by means of a list of char)
 and implements some methods similar to those of the class String.
 Specifically, implement a constructor that creates an object of the class starting from a string,
  and the methods concat(), equals(), substring(), length(), charAt(), indexOf(), and toUpperCase().
  Realize also a method, external to the class MyString,
  that behaves in the same way as the method Integer.parseInt().
  More precisely, given an object of the class MyString,
  the method should return the integer value corresponding to the numeric
  digits represented in the MyString object, or should throw an exception
  if the object contains characters that are different from the digits ’0’, . . . , ’9’.
 Implement the latter method both using iteration and using recursion.
