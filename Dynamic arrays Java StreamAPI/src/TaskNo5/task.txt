Define a class BigNumber, whose objects represent positive integers with an unbounded
number of digits, realized by means of a list of integers.
The class should implement a constructor that creates a BigNumber object starting
from a string of numeric digits, the methods to calculate the sum and difference of two BigNumbers,
the predicates to compare whether two BigNumbers are equal and whether one is smaller than another,
and the method toString that constructs the string corresponding to the number. For the difference,
return the object representing the number 0 in the case where the result of the subtraction would be
negative. We suggest to represent a BigNumber using a list of integers in which the least significant
digit is the first element of the list, and the most significant digit the last element of the list.
